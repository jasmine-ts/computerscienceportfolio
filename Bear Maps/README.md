# Bear Maps Project [Java]
* Created by Jasmine Tong-Seely, Oct-Nov 2020 *

Implemented backend parts of a web-browser based Google Maps clone specific to the city of Berkeley, CA. Supports map image selection and rastering at correct resolution given input coordinates of a rectangular grid, as well as optimal route finding between input locations powered by a self-written version of the A* search algorithm.
