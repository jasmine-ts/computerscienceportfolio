# World & Game Generation Project [Java]
*Created by Jasmine Tong-Seely and Ethan Fang, Nov-Dec 2020*

This is an engine that powers pseudorandom generation of explorable worlds given a user's input seed. It supports avatar creation and movement, as well as world state saving/loading via keyboard interaction. 

The StdDraw package is used to handle user input and create the game UI and HUD ("heads up display"). The TileEngine files provide basic methods for tile and world rendering.
